# Deep Learning 101
**MLP_minst.ipynb**
- Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch to classify digits in the MINST dataset.
- The layers in the MLP have both forward and backward pass implementations.
- PyTorch inbuilt functions is not utilized.
- Following features are implemented:
    - Fully-connected layer with bias.
    - ReLU and Sigmoid activations.
    - Mini-batch Gradient Descent (SGD) and Cross-Entropy loss.
